The script is a voice assistant that allows you to search for files or folders on your system using voice commands. It operates in the system's language and asks for a keyword to search for items containing that keyword. The search duration is displayed in real time. After finding results, it lists the document types found and asks which type you want to explore. You can further filter results by modification date, and the script provides the path to the selected files or folders.
